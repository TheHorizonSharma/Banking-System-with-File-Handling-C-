# Banking-System-with-File-Handling-C-
This project is a console-based banking management system built in C++ that handles essential banking functions with secure storage and efficient transaction logging.

The system features two distinct modes:

Admin Mode – Manage accounts, perform deposits/withdrawals, update account details, view all accounts, access transaction history, and close accounts.

User Mode – Log in securely, check balance, view personal transaction history, and close accounts.

Key Features:

Binary File Storage (Userinfo.dat) for secure account details.

Text File Logs (Transactions.txt) for transaction history.

Password Hashing for added security.

Unique Account Number Generation.

Deposit & Withdrawal Operations with instant balance updates.

Flexible Account Updates – Change name, phone, password, or all at once.

Account Closure – Removes account data and related transactions.

The design combines binary files for sensitive data with plain text logs for transparency, ensuring both security and easy access to transaction records.

This project demonstrates:

Structured programming with struct for account handling.

File handling (binary and text) in C++.

Menu-driven navigation for user interaction.

Persistent data storage across sessions.
